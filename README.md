# MVC-project
* For demo, please download MVC_project.jar
*	Implemented a Model-View-Controller in Processing that visualizes a network of vertices;
*	Designed MVC program to make it able to highlight all the vertices connected to the vertex under the mouse pointer, able to display the shortest path (implemented dijkstra's algorithm), able to allow the user to dynamically choose the probability of creating edges, and creates a brand new graph with its associated properties every time the probability is changed, etc.
